NumberOfPages
=============

A word count to page count predictor. This app predicts how many pages of formatted material you have, given a number of words/text, and formatting prefs (font size, font, spacing). No more copy-pasting into MS Word, just to figure out how many pages of printed content you have.

Written in Javascript. Uses Bootstrap CSS framework and jQuery. Applied Linear Regression to datapoints to get best fit equations for different initial conditions. Linear regression scripts written in Octave. Datapoints gathered by manipulating MS Word manually.
